# Lift & Shift the Color Application to Kubernetes - Step 4

The last step in the lift & shift exercise is to set the SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE value for each instance of blueorgreenservice.

## Configure Spring Boot profiles in deployment manifests

Run the following command to set the profile value in the deployment manifest.
```execute-1
array=( blue green slowgreen yellow )
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
    yq eval \
        '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[3].key = "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE"' \
        -i k8s/lift-and-shift/$i-deployment.yaml;
    
    yq eval \
        ".spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[3].value = \"$i\"" \
        -i k8s/lift-and-shift/$i-deployment.yaml;
done
```

## Deploy and test (WIP)

At this point, you can deploy the Color Application to Kubernetes.

Apply all of the yaml files to the cluster.
```execute-1
kubectl apply k8s/lift-and-shift/*
```

Run the following command to watch the status of the pods. 
Once all are `running`, type `Ctrl+C` to stop the `wait` command.
```execute-1

### need to port-forward to the auth gateway ??

### if port-forward, localhost:8080 dashboard used in local deployment should work

### can also test with curl or http providing creds at CLI
```

## Add an Ingress & ingress controller?
