# Lift & Shift the Color Application to Kubernetes - Step 4

The last step in the lift & shift exercise is to set the SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE value for each instance of blueorgreenservice.

## Configure Spring Boot profiles in deployment manifests

Run the following command to set the profile value in the deployment manifest.
```execute-1
array=( blue green slowgreen yellow )
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
    yq eval \
        '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[3].key = "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE"' \
        -i k8s/$i-deployment.yaml;
    
    yq eval \
        ".spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[3].value = \"$i\"" \
        -i k8s/$i-deployment.yaml;
done
```
