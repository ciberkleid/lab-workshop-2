## SANDBOX: Configure the Ingress

From the Kubernetes docs:

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. 
Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL/TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. 
An Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer, though it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic.

An Ingress does not expose arbitrary ports or protocols. 
Exposing services other than HTTP and HTTPS to the internet typically uses a service of type Service.Type=NodePort or Service.Type=LoadBalancer.

# SANDBOX: nginx

In this example, you will use the [nginx ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/README.md#readme)

Install nginx ingress controller.
```execute-
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.45.0/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
```
OR:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx-3.15.2/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
```
