# Refactor the Color Application for Kubernetes - Step 1

In the next set of exercises, you will refactor the Color Application in order to leverage native Kubernetes functionality.
You will eliminate Eureka and the Routing Gateway from the application architecture.

## Deployment and Service Manifests
Copy the manifests for all apps except Eureka and the Routing Gateway to a new directory.
```
mkdir k8s/refactor
cp k8s/lift-and-shift/* k8s/refactor/

rm k8s/refactor/eureka-deployment.yaml
rm k8s/refactor/eureka-service.yaml
rm k8s/refactor/gateway-deployment.yaml
rm k8s/refactor/gateway-service.yaml
```

## Configure Routing

Rather than control routing through the Routing Gateway, you will use an ingress controller. 
There are a variety of ingress controllers available in the Kubernetes ecosystem. 
One called [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) has been pre-installed in your workshop cluster, and an external load balancer has been pre-configured for you to route external traffic into the cluster.
You need to add the specific routing logic pertaining to the Color Application.

You can see the list of resources that Contour adds to Kubernetes by running the following command.
```execute-1
kubectl api-resources | grep -i contour
```

With Contour, you use the `HTTPProxy` resource to define routing rules.
You need to define routing rules to replace the routes currently defined in Java in the Routing Gateway.

Review the business logic defined in the Routing Gateway application.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: public RouteLocator routeLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
```

Create a new manifest file for the HTTPProxy resource definition.
```execute-1
mkdir -p ~/color-app/k8s/refactor
touch ~/color-app/k8s/refactor/httpproxy.yaml
```

Copy the following configuration to the new manifest file.
Notice that it matches the existing Java definitions and that it uses the service names defined in the yaml files you just copied from the lift-and-shift exercise.
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/color-app/k8s/refactor/httpproxy.yaml
line: 1

    apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
    kind: HTTPProxy
    metadata:
      name: color-app
    spec:
      virtualhost:
        fqdn: color-app.bar.com
      routes:
        - conditions: 
          - prefix: /blueorgreen
          services:
            - name: blue
              port: 8080
            - name: green
              port: 8080
            - name: slowgreen
              port: 8080
            - name: yellow
              port: 8080
        - conditions:
          - prefix: /
          services:
            - name: frontend
              port: 8080
        - conditions:
          - prefix: /js
          services:
            - name: frontend
              port: 8080
        - conditions:
          - prefix: /color
          services:
            - name: frontend
              port: 8080
```

Add the following configuration to the same manifest for the login/logout routes:
```editor:insert-lines-after-line
file: ~/color-app/k8s/refactor/httpproxy.yaml
line: 29
text: |
        - conditions:
          - prefix: /login
          services:
            - name: authgateway
              port: 8080
        - conditions:
          - prefix: /logout
          services:
            - name: authgateway
              port: 8080
```
