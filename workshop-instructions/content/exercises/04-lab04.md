# Lift & Shift the Color Application to Kubernetes - Step 2

Now that you have built and published the application images, you can attempt to deploy them to Kubernetes.
Each image will be deployed using a Kubernetes `deployment` resource. The deployment creates one or more pods, each with a running instance of the image (aka a container) of the corresponding application.
Each app will also need a Kubernetes `service` resource, which will load balance requests across all instances of a particular pod.
The deployment and service resources will be defined declaratively using manifests (yaml files).

## Create deployment manifests

Create the manifest for the `deployment` of each application.
For now, you will start with a single color instance (`blue`).
Use the `kubectl` CLI with the option `--dry-run=client` to generate the yaml without applying it to Kubernetes. 
```execute-1
mkdir -p k8s/lift-and-shift

kubectl create deployment blueorgreen \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenservice \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template

kubectl create deployment blueorgreenfrontend \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/frontend-deployment.yaml

kubectl create deployment blueorgreengateway \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/gateway-deployment.yaml

kubectl create deployment blueorgreenauthgateway \
            --image $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/authgateway-deployment.yaml
```

List all of the files you just created.
```execute-1
ls -l k8s/lift-and-shift/
```
The file `blueorgreen-deployment.template` will act as a template we can use 
to create deployment manifests for the various color apps.  We need to template
this deployment manifest in two places:

1. The name of the deployment
2. The Spring Boot profile we want to activate

Execute the following `sed` command to replace the `metadata.name` property
in the manifest with the template `$COLOR`.

```execute-1
sed -i '0,/name: blueorgreen/{s/name: blueorgreen/name: $COLOR/}' k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template
```

To activate the Spring Boot profile for the color we can set the environment
variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` in the container when it starts on Kubernetes.
To do this add the following templated environment variable to the manifest.

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file:  ~/color-app/k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.spec.containers[0]
value:
    env:
    - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
      value: $COLOR
```

Now we can substitute the variables in this template using the `envsubst` command line
utility and generate deployment manifests for each of the color apps.

```execute-1
COLOR=blue
export COLOR
envsubst < k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/lift-and-shift/blue-deployment.yaml

COLOR=green
export COLOR
envsubst < k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/lift-and-shift/green-deployment.yaml

COLOR=yellow
export COLOR
envsubst < k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/lift-and-shift/yellow-deployment.yaml

COLOR=slowgreen
export COLOR
envsubst < k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/lift-and-shift/slowgreen-deployment.yaml
```

## Create service manifests

Use the same "dry-run" approach as above to create the service manifests without applying them to Kubernetes.
In this step, you take advantage of the fact that all containers will be listening on port 8080 to make the service manifest configuration simpler as well.
Make sure to use the `spring.application.name` for the Kubernetes Service name so that Spring Cloud Kubernetes can locate the proper Service.
Notice that you are only including the blue instance for now uner the `blueandgreen` Service.
You will include the remaining colors at a later step.
```execute-1
kubectl create service clusterip blueorgreen \
            --tcp 80:8080 \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-service.yaml

kubectl create service clusterip blueorgreenfrontend \
            --tcp 80:8080 \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/frontend-service.yaml

kubectl create service clusterip blueorgreengateway \
            --tcp 80:8080 \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/gateway-service.yaml

kubectl create service clusterip blueorgreenauthgateway \
            --tcp 80:8080 \
            -o yaml --dry-run=true > k8s/lift-and-shift/authgateway-service.yaml
```

List all of the files you just created.
```execute-1
ls -l k8s/lift-and-shift/ | grep service
```

## Deploying The Applications

To `watch` the deployments happen run the following command

```execute-2
watch -n 1 kubectl get all
```

To deploy everything to Kubernetes run the following command

```execute-1
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/blue-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/green-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/slowgreen-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/yellow-deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/blueorgreen-service.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/gateway-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/gateway-service.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/frontend-service.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/authgateway-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/lift-and-shift/authgateway-service.yaml
```

```execute-1
kubectl port-forward service/blueorgreengateway --address 0.0.0.0 8080:80
```
